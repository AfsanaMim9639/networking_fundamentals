### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

**Purpose:**  
ARP is used in a network to **map a device's IP address to its MAC (hardware) address**.  

**Why it is needed:**  
- Devices communicate on a **local network using MAC addresses**.  
- IP addresses are logical addresses, but actual data transfer happens using **MAC addresses**.  
- ARP allows a device to find the MAC address corresponding to an IP so it can **send data correctly**.  

**Example:**  
- Your computer wants to send data to 192.168.1.5  
- It uses ARP to find out the MAC address of that IP  
- Then it sends data to that MAC address over the network
