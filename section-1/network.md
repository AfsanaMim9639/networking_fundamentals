## Networking & Protocols

### What is Networking?
Networking is the process of connecting computers and devices to share data and resources.

### What is a Protocol?
A protocol is a set of rules that defines how data is transmitted and received between devices.

### Common Networking Protocols

**Application Layer**
- **HTTP / HTTPS** – Web communication  
- **FTP** – File transfer  
- **DNS** – Domain name to IP resolution  
- **SMTP** – Send emails  
- **POP3 / IMAP** – Receive emails  
- **SSH** – Secure remote access  

**Transport Layer**
- **TCP** – Reliable, connection-oriented communication  
- **UDP** – Fast, connectionless communication  

**Network Layer**
- **IP (IPv4 / IPv6)** – Device addressing and routing  
- **ICMP** – Network diagnostics (ping)

**Data Link Layer**
- **ARP** – IP to MAC address mapping

---

- **NIC (Network Interface Card):**  
  A hardware component that connects a device to a network.

- **MAC Address:**  
  A unique physical address assigned to a NIC for device identification.

- **IP Address:**  
  A logical address used to identify a device on a network and enable communication.


  ### Types of Networks

There are **5 main types of networks**:

1. **PAN (Personal Area Network)** – Very small range (e.g., Bluetooth)
2. **LAN (Local Area Network)** – Home, office, school
3. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** – City-wide network
4. **WAN (Wide Area Network)** – Large geographic area (Internet)
5. **GAN (Global Area Network)** – Worldwide network

### Network Connectors

**Connectors** are hardware interfaces used to connect network cables to devices.

### Types of Network Connectors

1. **RJ45** – Used for Ethernet (LAN) cables  
2. **RJ11** – Used for telephone lines  
3. **Fiber Optic Connectors** – Used for high-speed networks  
   - SC
   - LC
   - ST
4. **BNC** – Used in older coaxial networks

### Ethernet Standards: 10BASE2 & 10BASE5

**10BASE2 (Thinnet)**
- Speed: 10 Mbps  
- Cable: Thin coaxial  
- Max Length: 185 meters  
- Connector: BNC  
- Used in small networks (rare today)

**10BASE5 (Thicknet)**
- Speed: 10 Mbps  
- Cable: Thick coaxial  
- Max Length: 500 meters  
- Connector: BNC  
- Used in older large networks

**Note:** Both are **old Ethernet technologies** and are mostly replaced by modern twisted-pair and fiber networks.

### Network Topology

**Topology** is the **layout or arrangement of devices and cables** in a network.

### Types of Network Topology

1. **Bus Topology** – All devices share a single cable  
2. **Star Topology** – Devices connect to a central hub/switch  
3. **Ring Topology** – Devices are connected in a circular loop  
4. **Mesh Topology** – Every device connects to every other device  
5. **Tree Topology** – Combination of star and bus topologies  
6. **Hybrid Topology** – Combination of two or more topologies
